# PyBer_Analysis

1.	The purpose of this analysis is to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city in order to improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

2.	In the table below, we can see the summary of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Customers in rural areas pay more fare than the suburban and urban areas.

3.	First recommendation is to consolidate the rural and suburban into one city type to absorb the cost. Second is to take about 10% of the urban drivers and add them to the rural drivers and make the line of the trip short. Third is to combine all three rural, suburban, and urban into one city type.
